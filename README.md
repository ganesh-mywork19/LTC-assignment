# LTC-assignment
This is a simple iOS application built with SwiftUI, designed to demonstrate the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. The app showcases how to structure an iOS project using MVVM principles for better separation of concerns, testability, and scalability. It provides a clear example of how to bind data from the model layer to the user interface in SwiftUI, while leveraging ViewModel for business logic and state management.<br>

In this application, a list of GitHub users will be fetched by making an API call and displayed each user's name and profile image on the UI.

**Key Features**:
  
  - SwiftUI for UI components<br>
  - MVVM architecture for clean code structure<br>
  - Data binding using SwiftUI's @Binding, @State, and @Observable (from Observation framework)<br>
  - Example of how to manage state and handle user interactions with ViewModel<br>
  - Simple, easy-to-understand project for learning MVVM in SwiftUI<br>
